    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Understand the relationship between Seaborn and Matplotlib, and when to use each \n",
    "* Create basic visualizations with Seaborn\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we'll explore several different kinds of visualizations we can create with Seaborn. Seaborn is built on top of Matplotlib, so you'll find that it will feel quite familiar. \n",

    "Let's get started by importing some things and creating a toy dataset to work with for our first visualization. \n",

    "\n",
    "* Import `numpy` and set the standard alias of `np`\n",
    "* Import `seaborn` and set the standard alias of `sns`\n",
    "* Set `%matplotlib inline` so that our visualizations appear in the notebook, and not as separate files"
